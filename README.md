# Design challenge - Nest Collective Summer Internship 2019

Design and build a web page to view upcoming events.

At Nest Collective, we have many events, from Nest itself and from each company. It‚Äôs crucial for us to have all that information available in one place. 

The main goal for this challenge is to build a layout that lets users easily identify the different types of events and, of course, their date/time. Think about what layout, visual clues, and functionalities would be more effective for someone reading/searching through all those events!

#### Information about each event
* Name
* Date / Hour
* Type
* Privacy
* Organizer
* Link
* Location
* Description

Use this [list of sample events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B_JRkkUW2KgO4bBZsxTj9ItvdPE3N7aktkKzOTStsrQ/edit?usp=sharing). Note: you don‚Äôt have to display all the events, nor all their info; use your best judgement!
