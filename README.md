# Design challenge - Nest Collective Summer Internship 2018

Design and build a web page to view upcoming events. 

At Nest Collective, we have many events, from Nest itself and from each company. It’s crucial for us to have all that information synchronized in one place. 

The main goal for this challenge is to build a layout that lets the users easily identify the different types of events, and of course their date. Think about what layout, visual clues, and functionalities would be more effective for someone reading/searching through all those events!

#### Information about each event
* Name
* Date / Hour
* Type
* Privacy
* Organizer
* Link
* Location
* Short description

Use this [list of sample events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B_JRkkUW2KgO4bBZsxTj9ItvdPE3N7aktkKzOTStsrQ/edit?usp=sharing). Note: you don’t have to display all the events above, nor all its info.

#### Process
* Research similar solutions
* Design a wireframe + mockup
* Build a prototype using HTML and CSS


You should fork this github repository and upload your work there to share it with us.

Feel free to ask us any questions you have throughout the day. At the end, we’ll meet to discuss your process, results and decisions. 

Good luck!
